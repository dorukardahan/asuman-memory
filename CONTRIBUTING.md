cd asuman-memory
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork & branch** from `main`
2. **Write tests** for new features or bug fixes
3. **Run checks locally** before pushing:
   ```bash
   ruff check agent_memory/ tests/ scripts/
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```
4. **Open a PR** with a clear description

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One concern per PR (ideally under 200 lines)
- Include tests for new endpoints or logic changes

- All CI checks must pass before merge

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+
- [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting (config in `pyproject.toml`)
- Line length: 120 characters

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run a specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_api.py -v

# Quick check (stop on first failure)
python -m pytest tests/ -x -q
```

Tests use an in-memory SQLite database and mock the embedding service. No external services required.
